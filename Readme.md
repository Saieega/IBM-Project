# AI-Powered Fault Detection in Power Distribution Systems

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to automatically detect and classify different types of faults in a power distribution system. By analyzing electrical measurement data, the model can distinguish between normal operating conditions and various fault types, enabling rapid response and improving grid reliability.

The model was developed using the AutoAI capabilities of IBM Watson Studio and is deployed as a scalable API on IBM Cloud.

## Project Overview

The objective is to build a robust classification model that takes real-time electrical data (voltage, current, etc.) as input and outputs a prediction of the grid's status. The model can identify the following conditions:

* Line Breakage
* Transformer Failure
* Overheating
* Normal Conditions

This automated identification is critical for minimizing power outage duration and preventing cascading failures in the grid.

## Dataset

The model was trained on the **Power System Faults Dataset**.

**Source:** Kaggle

**Features Include:**

* Voltage (V)
* Current (A)
* Power Load (MW)
* Temperature (Â°C)
